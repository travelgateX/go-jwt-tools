# go-jwt-tools

Golang authorization middleware for JWT tokens. JWT tools (auth0 or other)

There are two important features on this package:
- `authorization.go` contains a middleware that processes a token and checks its validity (authorizes).
- `permissions.go` handles the "PermissionsTable" struct which contains the information of the JWT token conveniently adapted, and a set of functions to use it.

## MiddleWare
### How to use

We just need to add a call to the function **`Authorize`** on all the calls that must be authorized (in this case, we use a **`Route`** struct that contains the `HandlerFunc` and a `bool` indicating if that `Route` must be authorized). `Authorize` expects the handler function to wrap and a configuration object of type **`Config`** (defined on `authorization.go` file).

**IMPORTANT**: The middleware stores the `PermissionTable` item on the [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/), under the key defined on the `ContextKey` constant.

### Example of use

```golang
func NewRouter() *mux.Router {
	router := mux.NewRouter().StrictSlash(true)

	// Prepare Authorization configuration
        c := authorization.Config{
		PublicKeyStr: "myKey",
		AdminGroup: "admin",
		IgnoreExpiration: false
	}

	for _, route := range routes {
		var handler http.Handler

		// Add Authorization or not
		if route.Authorization {
			handler = authorization.Authorize(route.HandlerFunc(), c)
		
		} else {
			handler = route.HandlerFunc()
		}

		handler = handlers.CompressHandler(util.CompressGzip(handler, route.GzipMandatory))

		router.
			Methods(route.Method).
			Path(route.Pattern).
			Name(route.Name).
			Handler(handler)
	}

	return router
}
```

After this, out `PermissionTable` will be stored on the `ContextKey` key of the context:

```golang
permissions := ctx.Value(authorization.ContextKey).(*authorization.PermissionTable)
``` 


## Permissions
### Functions

- `BuildPermissions(jwt interface{})`: Builds the PermissionTable object by traversing the given jwt token. It's **not necessary** to call this function as long as you have the authorization middleware set.

- `(t *PermissionTable) CheckPermission(product string, object string, per string, specials ...string) ([]string, bool)`: Checks the given permissions for a given product and object. Returns the special permissions applied on that object if any, and a boolean indicating if the user has the requested permission. **NOTE:** Special permissions returned can be filtered by the `specials` argument).

- `(t *PermissionTable) ValidGroups(product string, object string, per string) (map[string]bool)`: Returns all the groups and its permissions that have any permission for the given product and object.

- `(t *PermissionTable) GetAllGroups() (map[string]struct{})`: Returns the group hierarchy found in the token.

- `(t *PermissionTable) GetParents(group string) (map[string]interface{})`: Returns all the parent groups of a given group.

- `(t *PermissionTable) IsAdminFrom(group string) (bool)`: Returns `true` if the user has Admin permissions for the given group.

- `(t *PermissionTable) CheckGroupPermissions(group string, per string, args ...string) ([]string, bool)`: Same functionality as `CheckPermission` but for additional permissions only.
